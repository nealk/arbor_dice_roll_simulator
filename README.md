# Arbor Dice Roll Simulator

To run:

```python
uv run streamlit run home.py
```

If you don't have uv installed: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

You'll have a better time running this locally, but if you can't, it's also available on Streamlit Cloud (the performance is terrible though because it's running on the free tier): https://arbordicerollsimulator-mskacr96vs7yrf3ttqvztd.streamlit.app
